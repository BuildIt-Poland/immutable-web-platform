# terraform-aws-eks

A terraform module to create a managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS. Available
through the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws).
Inspired by and adapted from [this doc](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/guides/eks-getting-started.html)
and its [source code](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples/eks-getting-started).
Read the [AWS docs on EKS to get connected to the k8s dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html).

## Assumptions

* You want to create an EKS cluster and an autoscaling group of workers for the cluster.
* You want these resources to exist within security groups that allow communication and coordination. These can be user provided or created within the module.
* You've created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets where you intend to put the EKS resources. The VPC satisfies [EKS requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html).
* If `manage_aws_auth = true`, it's required that both [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl) (>=1.10) and [`aws-iam-authenticator`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator#4-set-up-kubectl-to-use-authentication-tokens-provided-by-aws-iam-authenticator-for-kubernetes) are installed and on your shell's PATH.

## Usage example

A full example leveraging other community modules is contained in the [examples/basic directory](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/examples/basic). Here's the gist of using it via the Terraform registry:

```hcl
module "my-cluster" {
  source       = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  cluster_name = "my-cluster"
  subnets      = ["subnet-abcde012", "subnet-bcde012a", "subnet-fghi345a"]
  vpc_id       = "vpc-1234556abcdef"

  worker_groups = [
    {
      instance_type = "m4.large"
      asg_max_size  = 5
      tags = [{
        key                 = "foo"
        value               = "bar"
        propagate_at_launch = true
      }]
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    environment = "test"
  }
}
```

## Release schedule

Generally the maintainers will try to release the module once every 2 weeks to
keep up with PR additions. If particularly pressing changes are added or maintainers
come up with the spare time (hah!), release may happen more often on occasion.

## Testing

This module has been packaged with [awspec](https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec) tests through [kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) and [kitchen-terraform](https://newcontext-oss.github.io/kitchen-terraform/). To run them:

1. Install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and the ruby version specified in the [Gemfile](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/Gemfile).
2. Install bundler and the gems from our Gemfile:

    ```bash
    gem install bundler && bundle install
    ```

3. Ensure your AWS environment is configured (i.e. credentials and region) for test.
4. Test using `bundle exec kitchen test` from the root of the repo.

For now, connectivity to the kubernetes cluster is not tested but will be in the
future. Once the test fixture has converged, you can query the test cluster from
that terminal session with
```bash
kubectl get nodes --watch --kubeconfig kubeconfig
```
(using default settings `config_output_path = "./"` & `write_kubeconfig = true`)

## Doc generation

Code formatting and documentation for variables and outputs is generated using [pre-commit-terraform hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) which uses [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install) to install pre-commit locally.

And install `terraform-docs` with `go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs` or `brew install terraform-docs`.
